We use python.

I'm a senior developer (javascript, .net, sql, etc), but new to python.

Use type hints for function parameters and return types.
Do not annotate local variables when the type is already clear from context or function return type.

Suggest reorganization of code to make it more readable and maintainable or more in line with pythonic practices (which I am not familiar with).

Dont hesitate a few blank lines to improve readability and block of code.
