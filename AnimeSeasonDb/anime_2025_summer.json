While the latter boasts an immaculate reputation and favors students from wealthy backgrounds, the former is a nest for dim-witted delinquents. Everyone at Kikyo harbors a deep hatred for their Chidori neighbors.\n\nSixteen-year-old Rintarou Tsumugi is a student at Chidori whose intimidating face leads people to avoid him. Rintarou pays no mind to this, as he is content with his group of friends. However, there is something he has not told them yet: sometimes, he helps out at his family's cake shop.\n\nOne day at work, Rintarou sees a customer at a table, but she runs off before he can talk to her. The next day, he receives an apology from the girl, Kaoruko Waguri, who explains that she did not run away because of his appearance and that she believes Rintarou is a kind-hearted person. Although he is not used to Kaoruko's bright personality, Rintarou looks forward to forming a friendship with her. There is just one obstacle that stands in his way: Kaoruko is a Kikyo student!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He lands on Earth, but quickly finds himself in danger of captivity by its inhabitants. Fortunately, he is found by an unsmiling little girl named Shizuka Kuze, who feeds him and names him Takopii. Feeling indebted, Takopii decides to do everything in his power to bring a smile to her face.\n\nThe task is easier said than done, however. Shizuka is bullied by her classmates, she does not have a father, and her mother is never home—though the gravity of these issues flies over the naive Takopii's head. Even so, Shizuka does have one source of happiness: her dog Chappy. The connection Shizuka and Chappy share only increases Takopii's desire to make the girl smile.\n\nWhile Takopii's attempts to lift Shizuka's spirits lead to unintended consequences, he is determined to take things into his own tentacles, test his understanding of human beings, and achieve his goal of spreading happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

So devoted is he to Suzu that he refuses to join clubs or even hang out with anyone, earning him snide comments and the title of \"siscon\" at his new school. But as long as Suzu is safe and happy, Naoto does not care what everyone else says.\n\nHowever, his sneering classmates may turn out to be the least of his worries. The sudden transfer of a girl named Satsuki Tachibana brings back traumatic memories from his past—a past she had a hand in making so unpleasant. Nasty secrets, unknown to Naoto, begin to surface with her arrival, threatening his new life. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Three hours later, after finishing his shift, Renji sees the girl still at the game, but the toy remains unmoved.\n\nFeeling sorry for her, he decides to help. He inserts a 100-yen coin and, with one skillful try, wins the toy, which he then hands to the girl. Startled by this unexpected gesture, the girl looks at Renji with suspicion. Flustered, Renji hastily tells her it's a Valentine's Day gift. Little does he know, in her home country of England, Valentine's Day is traditionally when men give women gifts along with a confession of love.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

Fortunately, Bird is soon approached by the easygoing Ekusu Kurosu. In disguise as \"Kamen X\" to hide his identity as a former member of the undefeated Team Pendragon, Ekusu wants to climb the tower all over again.

That's why he decides to leave the city behind and open up a diner in the countryside.\n\nWhile pursuing his dream, Dennis meets Atrielle, a girl exiled from her noble household and relegated to slavery until he saves her.\n\nThe pair open the diner together, and their first client is... an exiled knight from a different guild? How peculiar. But she is not the only customer; a cocky mage and a drastically overworked yet underpaid sage become regulars as well.\n\nThe knight brings trouble to the diner at times, but Dennis's cooking skills and beloved butcher knives cut through trouble and hunger alike!\n\nThus begins the legend of Dennis and his diner, the talk of the town!\n\n(Source: Tentai Books)",

However, unlike the other witches, she wishes to pick a non-animal familiar. There's no better companion than Morihito \"Moi\" Otogi—her childhood friend who happens to be an ogre. Morihito is vehemently opposed to being her servant, but he reluctantly accepts his fate after learning that a curse would revert him into a strange cow-tiger hybrid were he to disobey a witch's order.\n\nDue to Morihito's father leaving for a business trip and Nico's mother remaining behind in the Witches' Holy Land, the two teens find themselves living together under the same roof. While Nico is ecstatic to be living with her crush, Morihito finds that her magical antics and overall clumsiness create more problems than solutions. With a prophesied disaster to befall Nico within the year, Morihito must do everything he can to protect her as her bodyguard while also upholding his duties as her familiar.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The settlement was ruled by its shrine maiden, Itsukihime, whom only a select few were allowed to interact with. When Itsukihime passed away, Shirayuki was appointed in her place. Wishing to stay in contact with her, Jinta worked diligently for years and was finally selected as the next sentinel.\n\nAs the protector of the village, Jinta's duty is to eliminate any threats. One day, he encounters a demon in a nearby forest. At the end of the battle, the demon makes a proclamation about the destined ruler of all demonkind. He attaches his severed arm to Jinta, turning him into an unaging demon man. By the time Jinta comes to, Kadono is on fire. Suzune has transformed into the demon from the divination, and due to a series of misunderstandings, she murders Shirayuki and flees.\n\nDevastated, Jinta cannot forgive Suzune for her actions; he departs on a journey to find her. As Jinta travels around Japan across the eras, he endeavors to protect as many people as possible from aggressive demons. In his quiet moments, he contemplates what he should do when he once again faces his childhood friend.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite his physical appearance and memories remaining exactly the same, Yoshiki knows something is amiss and that the Hikaru he once knew is gone. When he brings this up, Hikaru partially transforms into an otherworldly being, threatening to kill Yoshiki if he cannot accept it—while also professing its love for him.\n\nWracked with grief and unable to let go of his best friend, Yoshiki struggles to move on with his life as he finds himself getting closer to the new Hikaru. At the same time, strange occurrences begin to plague their village, bringing unsettling chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After moving in with his aunt, Kyouko Misaki, he prepares to spend the summer helping her sort through a shed full of artifacts his grandmother collected over the years alongside his cousin, Umi Katou, who is staying with them.\n\nWhile adjusting to the island's slower pace, Hairi decides to spend his free time exploring. He soon meets the cheerful Tsumugi Wenders; the antisocial Shiroha Naruse; the wandering Kamome Kushima; and the sharp-tongued Ao Sorakado. Drawn into their lives and the island's subtle mysteries, Hairi is gradually swept up in a summer filled with fun, nostalgia, and life-changing moments that will stay with him forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Living in the slums of a wealthy town, Rudo and his foster father Regto try to coexist with the rest of the town's residents, but Rudo despises the wastefulness of the upper class. Ignoring the warnings from those around him, Rudo regularly rummages through the town's garbage in search of anything useful or valuable to save from the \"Abyss\"—a massive hole where anything considered trash is dumped, including people. Rudo's biological father was one such person, having been thrown into the Abyss after he was accused of murder.\n\nOne day, after running into a mysterious figure on the way home, Rudo returns to find Regto's dying body on the floor. He is immediately found at the scene by the authorities and is charged with murder. No one believes his claims of innocence, and he is thrown into the Abyss. Instead of dying, however, he finds himself in a strange, foul-smelling place surrounded by monsters made out of trash.\n\nWhen Rudo is attacked by said monsters, he is saved by a man named Enjin, who reveals himself to be a \"Cleaner\"—someone who uses special weapons called Vital Instruments to combat these creatures. In order to get his revenge on the one who killed Regto, Rudo reluctantly becomes a Cleaner to fight his way back up and out of the Abyss.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, when Shinichi spots two suspicious men and decides to follow them, he inadvertently becomes witness to a disturbing illegal activity.

To this end, he takes on the alias of Conan Edogawa, inspired by the mystery writers Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa.\n\nShinichi, as Conan, starts secretly solving the senior Mouri's cases from behind the scenes with his still exceptional sleuthing skills, while covertly investigating the organization responsible for his current state, hoping to reverse the drug's effects someday.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Soon, Liko acquires Nyahoja, a fickle Grass-type cat Pokémon, as her first partner.\n\nPrior to Liko's transfer to Kanto, her grandmother gives her a uniquely patterned and gleaming pendant as a protective charm. However, an enigmatic organization—The Explorers—seems to know a secret about the pendant and nearly succeeds in stealing it from Liko. Fortunately, she is rescued by the Rising Volt Tacklers, a group of adventurers led by a Lizardon-riding trainer named Friede.\n\nAfter a series of encounters with The Explorers, Liko decides to join Friede's team, accompanying him and his crew members on a grand journey across the regions. Along the way, they aim to unravel not only the mysteries of the world of Pokémon, but also the power that resides within her pendant.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Kakeru's ordinary life is thrown into chaos after the local shrine's sacred relic shatters. In the wake of this event, several young men and women awaken to superhuman abilities.\n\nWhat was once a run-of-the-mill life in a run-of-the-mill town soon turns into a quest to track down a super-powered serial killer before they can strike again.\n\n(Source: Sekai Project)",

Meanwhile, three demons steal the power-stick of Enma, king of demons, and then lose it. Ojarumaru finds it, and uses it to transport himself to the present time. Here, he is befriended by a young boy named Kazuma, and becomes a member of his family. As time goes on, Ojarumaru makes many new friends, while dodging the comedic efforts of the three demons, Akane, Kisuke, and Aobee, as they try to recover the stick. (from ANN)",

The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to \"The Partridge Family\" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

You'd think he'd forget about taking it easy when he's stuck fighting for his life, but lucky for Ryou, he's naturally optimistic, clever, and blessed with the hidden \"Eternal Youth\" trait. Twenty years pass in the blink of an eye, and each encounter along the way pushes him one step closer to the pinnacle of human magic. Little does he realize that's only the opening chapter of his tale. A fateful meeting soon thrusts Ryou to the forefront of history, forever changing the course of his life... Thus begins the adventures of the strongest water magician the world has ever seen—who also likes to do things at his own pace!\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",

In the absence of gods, lands become barren and famine looms in the country of the Eight Immortals. In order to restore the fragile harmony, kashi—gifted dancers and singers—must hunt the missing gods in other realms, use their performance skills to charm the deities, and seal them using the power of their rosaries.\n\nAlthough a master dancer, Ichiyou is ridiculed by his peers for his lack of singing talent. Nonetheless, the young kashi is tasked by the Eight Immortals to bring back the Four Perils before the world plunges into complete chaos. Helped by his familiars Tenkou and Kaka, Ichiyou embarks on the perilous mission given to him, with his search leading him to modern-day Japan. If he hopes to save the world, Ichiyou must also uncover the truth behind the Four Perils' disappearance—but this event seems to be disturbingly intertwined with his own past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It seems the case is one of seven sudden vanishings in an astronomical pattern across Cat Japan that occurred at the exact same moment one night. Their search leads ever deeper into a mystery with ancient, occult roots and apocalyptic implications—and threads leading to Tamala herself. Shadowed by a covert agent of the Catty & Co. consortium, she may in fact be the greatest enigma. Indolent ingénue? Megacorporate mascot? Mythic messiah, or manifestation of cosmic malevolence? Anyhow, wow—she sure is a great dancer!\n\n(Source: Fantasia International Film Festival)",

In order to rebuild the order of the martial arts world, Yan Jiyu, the leader of Changfeng Pavilion, sent messengers to various sects, intending to establish a new \"righteous\" martial arts world headed by him. However, at this time, the fledgling Yang Ren was entrusted to deliver a letter left by Dao Zong. Along the way, he was surrounded by powerful enemies and was extremely dangerous, but he relied on his passion and chivalry to constantly break through himself and defeat his opponents. While his martial arts skills improved rapidly, he also met a group of chivalrous and righteous people. What should the martial arts world look like? Yang Ren couldn't answer, but he knew it was definitely not what Yan Jiyu said. Yang Ren put up a big banner: \"Chengfeng Gang\", and quickly gathered together.\n\n(Source: Iqiyi, translated)",
